## Health_Insurance_Premium_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
### Project Overview :  
This project aims to predict health insurance premiums using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as Age(yrs), Gender, BMI, Height (cm), and Weight(kg) the model provides an estimate of the insurance premium.   
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to health insurance applicants:
- Age(yrs)
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Height (cm) 
- Weight(kg)  
- Health Insurance cover
- Premium
### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded the dataset and handled missing values.
   - Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the quality of data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted through EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.
   - Visualized data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model accuracy.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Trained multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, KNeighbors Regressor 
   - Evaluated models using metrics like RÂ², MAE, and RMSE.
  ### Tools and Libraries
